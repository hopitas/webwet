INSTALLATION:

Software NEEDS to be in webwet folder at your root www dir, because that's where arduino is trying to look for it!

Web software needs basic LAMP installation. Database arduino.sql needs to be imported to mysql.

Default username: admin
password:

In tab3 can be used to show web camera. I've used zoneminder (because it is really nice and free surveillance software ^^) and show the stream with:

<img src="http://YOUR.URL/cgi-bin/nph-zms?mode=jpeg&monitor=3&scale=100&maxfps=15&buffer=1000&user=USERNAME&pass=PASSWORD&connkey=914020&rand=1355500785" alt="Edit source in tab3.html to add camera if you got one.">


It could be something fancier, I know...

.htaccess files need to be enabled in apache2 server to make logout functionality work. 
.htaccess is used to make html pages run php code that is needed to check user login and make redirects accordingly.
Change in:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/default

        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
                # Uncomment this directive is you want to see apache2's
                # default start page (in /apache2-default) when you go to /
                #RedirectMatch ^/$ /apache2-default/
        </Directory>



AllowOverrride None -> AllowOverride All

After that reload apache:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

The software works either with 1) ethernet/wifi shield or 2) serial connection to server

1)

Use irrigation_eth_multiprobe arduino software

2)

Use irrigation_serial_multiprobe arduino software
You need to setup python_serial_script to be running as daemon in server. It takes care of communicating between arduino 
serial and php. Check that serial bus is correct one and that you got needed python libraries installed:

import serial
import httplib
import urllib

Have fun, fix my code please and ask questions via email

thx, hopey ;)
